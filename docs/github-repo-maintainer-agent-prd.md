# GitHub Repository Maintainer Agent - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for an intelligent GitHub repository maintainer agent that automatically monitors and manages Dependabot pull requests across all owned repositories. The agent will identify failed GitHub Actions checks on Dependabot PRs and create actionable issues with clear remediation instructions.

## Problem Statement

Repository owners often struggle to keep track of failed Dependabot pull requests across multiple repositories. When dependency updates fail CI/CD checks, they require manual investigation and intervention. This creates maintenance overhead and delays important security updates.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

- Automate the detection of failed Dependabot pull requests across all owned repositories
- Generate actionable issues with clear remediation instructions
- Reduce manual overhead in repository maintenance
- Ensure dependency updates are promptly addressed

### Secondary Goals

- Provide intelligent analysis of failure patterns
- Enable scalable repository management across large numbers of repositories
- Integrate seamlessly with existing GitHub workflows

## Target Users

- **Primary User**: Repository owners and maintainers
- **Secondary Users**: Development teams managing multiple repositories
- **Tertiary Users**: Open source project maintainers

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Repository Discovery and Analysis

#### Story 1.1: Discover Owned Repositories

**As a** repository owner  
**I want** the agent to automatically discover all repositories where I am the owner  
**So that** I don't have to manually configure which repositories to monitor

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent uses GitHub API to fetch all repositories where the authenticated user is the owner
- Agent handles pagination for users with many repositories
- Agent respects GitHub API rate limits
- Agent filters out archived repositories (configurable)
- Agent logs the number of repositories discovered

#### Story 1.2: Identify Dependabot Pull Requests

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to identify all open Dependabot pull requests  
**So that** only relevant PRs are analyzed for failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent identifies PRs created by the Dependabot user account
- Agent filters for open PRs only
- Agent handles repositories with no open PRs gracefully
- Agent logs the number of Dependabot PRs found per repository

### Epic 2: GitHub Actions Analysis

#### Story 2.1: Detect Failed GitHub Actions Checks

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to detect which Dependabot PRs have failed GitHub Actions checks  
**So that** I can focus on PRs that need attention

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent queries GitHub Actions check runs for each Dependabot PR
- Agent identifies checks with "failure", "cancelled", or "timed_out" status
- Agent captures the specific workflow name and job that failed
- Agent ignores successful or pending checks
- Agent handles PRs with no checks gracefully

#### Story 2.2: Analyze Failure Details

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to analyze the failure details intelligently  
**So that** the generated issues contain relevant context

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent extracts failure logs from GitHub Actions
- Agent uses LLM to categorize failure types (e.g., dependency conflicts, test failures, build errors)
- Agent identifies if failures are related to "pip install" or dependency installation
- Agent provides structured failure analysis in the issue

### Epic 3: Issue Creation and Management

#### Story 3.1: Create Actionable Issues

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to create detailed issues for failed Dependabot PRs  
**So that** I have clear instructions on how to resolve the failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent creates one issue per failed Dependabot PR
- Issue title includes repository name, PR number, and failure type
- Issue body includes:
  - Link to the failed PR
  - Summary of the failure
  - Specific workflow and job that failed
  - Instructions to check the failed workflow
  - Reminder to verify "pip install" works according to repo instructions
  - Relevant logs or error messages
- Issue is created in the same repository as the failed PR

#### Story 3.2: Assign Issues to GitHub Copilot

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** issues to be automatically assigned to GitHub Copilot  
**So that** I can leverage AI assistance for resolution

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent assigns the created issue to the GitHub Copilot user (if available)
- Agent handles cases where GitHub Copilot assignment is not possible
- Agent logs assignment status for each issue

#### Story 3.3: Prevent Duplicate Issues

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to avoid creating duplicate issues  
**So that** my repository doesn't get cluttered with redundant issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent checks for existing open issues related to the same PR
- Agent uses a consistent labeling system to identify agent-created issues
- Agent updates existing issues if the failure status changes
- Agent closes issues when the associated PR is merged or closed

### Epic 4: Intelligent Decision Making

#### Story 4.1: LLM-Powered Analysis

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to use AI to make intelligent decisions about failures  
**So that** the generated issues are contextually relevant and actionable

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent uses a structured LLM system prompt for consistent analysis
- Agent employs Pydantic models for structured output validation
- Agent categorizes failures into predefined types
- Agent suggests specific remediation steps based on failure type
- Agent maintains conversation context for related failures

#### Story 4.2: Customizable Issue Templates

**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want** the agent to generate issues using intelligent templates  
**So that** the issues follow a consistent, professional format

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agent uses LLM to craft issue descriptions based on failure context
- Agent includes repository-specific context when available
- Agent maintains a professional, helpful tone
- Agent includes all necessary technical details
- Agent formats issues using proper Markdown

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication and Security

- Agent authenticates using GitHub Personal Access Token or GitHub App
