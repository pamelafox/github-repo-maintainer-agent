    issue_description: |
      ## Issue Description
      
      This repository contains references to auto-approve actions or Copilot SWE agent in workflow files, but should have a dedicated workflow to auto-approve PRs from the GitHub Copilot agent.
      
      ## Recommended Action
      
      Create a new workflow file at `.github/workflows/auto_approve_copilot.yaml` with the following content:
      
      ```yaml
      name: Auto-approve Copilot PRs
      
      on:
        pull_request:
          types: [opened, synchronize]
      
      jobs:
        auto-approve:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          if: github.actor == 'copilot-swe-agent'
          steps:
            - name: Auto-approve PR from Copilot agent
              uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3
              with:
                github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      ```
      
      This workflow will:
      - Automatically approve PRs created by the `copilot-swe-agent`
      - Use the `hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3` action for reliable auto-approval
      - Only run on PRs from the Copilot agent for security
      
      ## Benefits
      
      - Streamlines the development workflow with Copilot
      - Reduces manual intervention for agent-created PRs
      - Maintains security by only auto-approving specific agent PRs
