    issue_title: "Update Ubuntu runner from ubuntu-20.04 to ubuntu-latest in GitHub workflows"
    issue_description: |
      GitHub workflow files are using the outdated `ubuntu-20.04` runner image.
      
      **Issue:** Ubuntu 20.04 runners are deprecated and will be removed by GitHub.
      
      **Recommendation:** Please update all instances of `ubuntu-20.04` to `ubuntu-latest` in your GitHub Actions workflow files.
      
      **Benefits of ubuntu-latest:**
      - Always uses the most recent stable Ubuntu LTS version
      - Receives the latest security updates and patches
      - Includes updated tooling and dependencies
      - Future-proofs your workflows against deprecation
      
      **Files that need updating:** Check the workflow files in `.github/workflows/` directory.
      
      **Example change:**
      ```yaml
      # Before
      runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
      
      # After  
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      ```
      
      Please review and update the affected workflow files to use `ubuntu-latest` instead of the deprecated `ubuntu-20.04`.
