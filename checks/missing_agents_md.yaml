      ## Issue Description

      This repository is missing an `AGENTS.md` file at the root. That file is used to **onboard a coding agent (like GitHub Copilot's automation agents)** so it can work efficiently and correctly in this codebase.

      Providing high-quality, explicit repository instructions dramatically reduces:
      - Broken or failing CI / build attempts
      - Wasted exploration (grep/find excessive searches)
      - Incorrect environment setup
      - PR churn due to missing context

      ## Required Action

      Create a new `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root with the following high‑level sections (in this order):

      1. **Overview** – What the project does, main technologies, primary entry points.
      2. **Code layout** – Bullet list of important files / folders with brief purpose (Python modules, infra/Bicep, workflows, scripts, config). Omit trivial or generated files.
      3. **Running the code** – Step‑by‑step environment setup (preferred Python version / tool, how to install deps, how to run main scripts). Prefer using GitHub Models if applicable over Azure-only model configs.
      4. **Running the tests** – Exact commands to run the test suite (include any required env vars, virtualenv activation, or formatting/lint steps if enforced by CI).
      5. **Upgrading Python dependencies** – How to add or upgrade a dependency (e.g., edit `requirements.txt` and run a pin/update command). Include any tools (pip, uv, etc.).
      6. **Release / build / deployment notes** (if applicable) – Any scripts, workflows, or manual steps the agent must respect.
      7. **Conventions & gotchas** – Linting rules, code style, required env vars, secrets handling, common pitfalls.
      8. **Validation checklist** – A short ordered list the agent should follow before opening a PR (e.g., tests pass locally, formatting applied, no stray debug prints, etc.).
      9. **When to search** – A closing note instructing the agent to trust `AGENTS.md` and only perform source-wide searches if information is missing or incorrect.

      ## Authoring Guidelines (Summarized from canonical AGENTS.md guidance)

      - Be explicit: Prefer concrete commands over prose (e.g., `pytest -q` not “run tests”).
      - Verify every command before including it.
      - List required environment variables and how they’re obtained.
      - Document any non-obvious build or test ordering.
      - Surface known flaky areas, hacks, or TODO hotspots if they affect modification strategy.
      - Keep it concise but information-dense—optimize for an automated agent, not a marketing audience.

      ## Example Skeleton

      ```markdown
      # AGENTS.md

      ## Overview
      <1–3 paragraph summary>

      ## Code layout
      - `agent.py` – Entry point for ...
      - `checks/` – YAML definitions for automated repo code checks
      - `infra/` – Bicep templates for infra provisioning
      - `.github/workflows/` – CI/CD workflows
      ...

      ## Running the code
      1. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
      2. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      3. Run main script: `python agent.py --help`

      ## Running the tests
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      pytest -q
      ```

      ## Upgrading Python dependencies
      Edit `requirements.txt`, then: `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run tests.

      ## Validation checklist
      - [ ] Virtualenv active
      - [ ] `pytest -q` passes
      - [ ] No debug prints
      - [ ] Updated docs if behavior changed

      ## When to search
      Only search the codebase if required info is missing or appears outdated.
      ```

      ## Acceptance Criteria

      - `AGENTS.md` exists at repository root
      - Contains all required sections above
      - Commands verified and minimal
      - Provides actionable, agent-focused guidance

      Adding this file will significantly improve automated contribution quality.
